### NeoForge Compatibility
SellingGen is built for **Minecraft 1.21.1** and supports all NeoForge versions in the **21.1.x** series.

Because the mod does not use mixins or deep NeoForge APIs, it is compatible with:
- NeoForge 21.1.0+
- Prism Launcher NeoForge builds
- Server and client environments

If you are running Minecraft 1.21.1 with NeoForge 21.1.x, SellingGen will work.


Tools folder Includes the python script to overide and merge the previous sellingbin.json as well as a html file for reading and debugging console logs.
